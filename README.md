# SAO-Management-System

This is the project I implemented in my Database Class to test our abilities to use mysql and php to design a proper website for an organization within our university. The aim of the website is to show and display the university's clubs, and events and give the possibility to people with credentials to manipulate each (create, add, delete, update, etc..). A desktop application using java was also requested.
